## 📈 **What to Expect**

```

## ⚠️ **Important Notes**

### **1. Trust the Process**
DeepSeek uses institutional logic that may seem conservative at times. This is intentional - capital preservation is priority #1.

### **2. Minimum Confidence: 50%**
- 50% might seem low, but with proper risk management:
- Small positions at 50% confidence = controlled risk
- Large positions only at 70%+ confidence = big winners
- This creates asymmetric risk/reward profile

### **3. No Override**
You've removed all other AI models. DeepSeek's decision is final. This is pure institutional trading - trust the hedge fund DNA.

### **4. Chain-of-Thought Logging**
DeepSeek will log its reasoning process:
```
🤔 Thinking: "MACD bullish BUT volume declining..."
💡 Decision: "HOLD - Waiting for volume confirmation"
Confidence: 45% (below threshold, no trade)
```

Read these logs to understand institutional thinking!
